# Web based Aquarium LED controller
I didn't want to pay 200€ to buy a 6 channel LED PWM controller. So I invested 400€ and a half year to build it myself :)

## Keyfeatures
- 6 channels PWM controlled (For LEDs and other stuff like CO2 relay or PC fan to cool water surface
- Web based interface to set up channel independent scenarious
- Temperature controlled water surface cooling (Really cool in summer)
- SD card bootloader and ethernet based file transfer to SD card
